My name is Uduak Oscar I was assigned the role as the design team lead.
During the course of the project phase I created the style guide for the project and was assisted by a team.(https://www.figma.com/file/h4z1WucYksn2jffHUW4VDE/Zuri-proj_team_55-team-library?node-id=0%3A1)
For the design i designed the signup and login screens
I also did the overview of all the screens, their alignment, typography, color as well as flow(https://www.figma.com/file/h4z1WucYksn2jffHUW4VDE/Zuri-proj_team_55-team-library?node-id=497%3A143)
