My name is Efe Ekojawe.
I was assigned the role of designing the API documentation page.
I carried out this task by creating wireframes of how the page would look like aesthically.
I also worked alongside other team memebers in carrying out this task.
I also ensured that the designs were understood by the developers to carry out the task effectively.
Here is the link to the figma board where you can see the API documentation pages:
